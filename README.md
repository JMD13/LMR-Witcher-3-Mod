This is mainly for me to keep track of the mod in case it needs to be updated in the future. 

I recommend just downloanding the mod from nexus instead.

To use this file in the game you need to change its encoding to UTF-16 LE BOM and obviously recreate the proper folder structure for Witcher 3 mods.
